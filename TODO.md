- fix the django admin so that it works (the static files are not being served right now)
- obviously overhaul the web UI to make it less crazy (i.e. ability to see the whole code and edit it for every program, etc.)
- ability to run a subrenderer for a specific program and see a preview ... and its errors! example recently fixed problem: p5.js didn't have access to the fake-browser Image object. that error was easy to see from the subrenderer - how do we percolate that to the web...?
